(Black screen, clock sound)

*Beep beep*

A : "Hey, wake up!!!
    "[M]!!!"
    "We're gonna be late for school!!"

"..."

A voice calls me in the middle of my sleep. Can't say that it's my first time hearing it.

I quickly recognize the owner of that voice. It's from [A], my good friend since we were little, a girl who values happiness over anything else.

You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?

M : "..."
    "What? What time is it?"

A : "It's already 7:50"
    "Hurry up. I don't want to be late again"
    "Why are you always oversleeping like this?"
    
We would usually get up early and walk to school together. But recently I have been oversleeping more and more frequent.

M : "S-Sorry. I was so busy that I stayed up late yesterday."
    "..."

A : "Did you spend the entire night just watching anime again?"

M : "Of course not...!!"
    "..."

How does she always read me like a book?

Maybe it's because we have been friends for so long, and she knows that I love staying up at night to watch anime

A : "You know that's not a healthy way to live, right?"
    "You have to care more about your health, [M]..."
    "I'm afraid that you won't be able to do anything once I'm not here anymore..."
    
That's typical of her to care for other people like that.

I don't mean that's a a bad thing, of course. It's nice to have someone care about you so much.

I just don't want people to look at us and think we're a couple or something.

To be honest, I do feel guilty of my unhealthy lifestyle sometimes.

But if I'm having fun staying up late to watch anime, then I don't think it can be that bad, right?

A : "..."
    "Whatever! We're wasting time. Hurry up and get ready for school"

I quickly get dressed, and grab the sandwich that my mom prepared for me last night, and we make our way to school

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's the middle of winter.

A light breeze causes the naked branches to rattle like wooden windchimes.

I can't help but feel numb as the snow gradually thickens. Each of my breath is clearly visible under this cold weather.

To be honest, this is one of those rare ocassions where I would pay close attention the nature around me, even though we're about to be late for school.

...

We can see the school from far away.

It's a well-established school, and is also well-known for being strict in terms of time.

Me and [A] have been studying in the same school for basically all of our lives.

As we draw near, the street becomes increasingly speckled with other students making their daily commute.

The bell rings as soon as we arrive.

A : "Yay!!! We made it just in time."

It left me thinking how we were never late to school, despite oversleeping almost everyday.

But it isn't something too important. The good thing is that we never got caught.

We were breathless as we make our way to the classroom

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The school day is as ordinary as ever, and it's over before I even know it.

In fact, I don't think there has been a day where I would consider school 'fun'.

I can't wait to get back home and watch some more anime.

After I pack up my things, I stared blankly for a few seconds. I had a feeling that something was going to happen.

A : "H-Hey [M]!!"

I turn around. It's [A] with a mischievous smile on her face.

Things can't be good when you see that kind of smile on her face.

She must have come in the classroom while I was spacing out.

I look around and realize that I'm the only one left in the classroom.

A : "I thought I'd catch you coming out of the room, but I saw you just sitting here and spacing out, so I came in"
    "By the way..."
    "The teacher insisted that we join a club"
    "You know, so we can socialize and stuff...?"
    "Which one do you think we should join?"
    
M : "Clubs, huh?"
    "..."

I find myself not being able to give a proper answer, probably because I have no other interest other than watching anime

If there's one thing I hate the most, then it's probably having to go out and talk to people that I don't know.

This is the part where [A] would care about other people too much, even when I would do perfectly fine just staying at home and watch some good animes.

M : "...I told you already, I have no interest in joining a club"
    "I haven't been looking, either."
    
But suddenly I stopped, as if I had just realized something

M : "..."
    "But we can join something like an anime club, if there's something like that..."

A : "I-I don't think there's such thing as an anime club in our school..."
    "Besides, how is watching anime going to help you socialize more?"
    "..."
    "Remember what I said earlier about how I was worried that you wouldn't learn to make new friends?"
    "Your happiness is really important to me, you know?"
    "And I know that you're happy now. But I'd die at the thought of you becoming a NEET in a few years because you're not used to the real world"
    "So don't make me keep worrying about you, okay?"
    
Well, if she really wants me to be part of a club, then I really have no choice, do I?

M : "Okay then..."
    "But which club do you think we should join?"

A : "I don't think it matters to me. If there's a club that makes you happy, then I'm fine with it too!!"

I let out a long sigh, not knowing what can interest me other than watching anime

M : "I think most clubs are full right now, aren't they?"

A : "Yeah?"

M : "Maybe we can find some clubs that lack members on the school's notice board."
    "Then we can decide which club we should join, if that'll make you happy?"

A : "Wow that's actually a pretty good idea"
    "I don't think you've said something as clever as this in quite a long time"
    "Hehe~"
    
I give her a sarcastic smile, not knowing whether she's really mocking me or she's just that carefree.

M : "But I can't promise that I'll join any of them, okay?"

A : "Don't worry!! I'm sure we can find something that you like!!"
    "Will you at least promise me that you'll try a little?"
    
M : "Well, I guess I can promise you that"

A : "Yay~!!"

I still can't believe that I'm joining a club.

But I guess if I can see her smiling so happily like this, then maybe it's worth it after all.

We head outside.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We find ourselves standing in front of the notice board.

There are posters on the wall, each of them having their own unique decorations, and they all look really colorful.

There are many clubs, but most of them already have enough members.

A : "There aren't many clubs in need of members right now"
    "..."
    "How about this photography club? I think it looks pretty fun"
    "What do you think?"

She points on the poster of the photography club. It's a very eye-catching one, to be honest.

It says that this club was just started yesterday, so there hasn't been any members yet.

A : "We can help to build this new club!!"
    "Besides, there hasn't been any members yet, which means you won't have too much trouble trying to make friends, right?"
    
M : "I don't know about this..."
    "Photography isn't really my thing..."

I probably haven't even taken a single photo for the last few years...
    
But on second thought, I guess photography isn't something that's too hard.

So if I manage my time properly, I can still have lots of time to watch some anime

M : "...But I'm fine with anything that you choose"
    "..."

A : "~Yay!! Let's go then!!"

Why do I let myself get led by the nose by such a carefree girl?

More than that, I'm even more surprised that I let myself relent to her.

Maybe seeing her caring so much about me makes me want to ease her mind at least a little bit - even if she does exaggerate everything inside of her head.

But maybe it's interesting to try out something new every once in a while.

With that, we decided to apply for the Photography Club.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been a few days since we registered for the club, and we finally got our acceptance letter.

Maybe it's because this club has no members, so I was pretty confident that there was no way that we were rejected.

But I'm starting to worry about my decision about joining this club.

How would the Club President react if she finds out that I only joined because [A] asked me to?

...

Maybe if I'm careful, she won't find out.

I shouldn't be thinking about bad things right now. Because tomorrow is going to be a good day for sure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Beep beep*

(scene Street)

It's an ordinary school day, but something feels different.

Maybe it's because I haven't joined any clubs for a long time now, so this feels very new to me.

A : "Ready to walk to school together, [M]?"

M : "Yeah sure"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(scene Hallway)

I follow [A] across the school and upstairs - a section of the school I rarely visit, being generally used for third-year classes and activities.

I'm starting to feel anxious, as I don't know what I should say to the President once me meet her.

[A], on the other hand, swings open the classroom door with full energy.

I hesitate for a split second at the door, freezing on the spot.

I glance around the classroom.

It's pretty spacious, and there are decorations and posters on the wall.

The President must have carefully prepared for this day.

I see a girl sitting at one of the desks, with her face buried in a book.

M : "U-Uhm..."

She suddenly notices that we're standing at the door.

C : "Oh [A]! I'm glad that you came here?"
    "Welcome to the club!!"
    "Please allow me to introduce myself first..."
    "I'm [C], President of the photography club. I hope we can get along with each other."
    
I don't think she needs any introduction at all, as she's probably the most popular girl in school.

Smart, beautiful, that 's what makes her stand out, especially to the boys.

Basically, completely out of my league.

She suddenly turns torwards me.

C : "And you must be [M]? [A] always says nice things about you!"
    "It's a pleasure to meet you!!"
    
I guess that [A] couldn't wait until this day that she started texting [C] first.

M : "H-Hi. I'm [M]"

And after that?

All words escape me in this situation.

M : "My hobbies are anime and reading light..."

I suddenly stop, as I don't really want people to see me as a NEET.

M : "...I really hope to get along well with everyone, even though I haven't had much experience in photography"

A few awkward seconds pass by, as I don't know how I should continue my conversation with her.

I'm being so boring. This is like every self-introduction ever. I should say something more. Something more exciting.

[C] notices my helpless expression, and quickly breaks the silence.

C : "You don't need to force yourself too much..."
    "I know a lot of people who aren't comfortable with speaking with others"
    "Just make yourself at home, okay?"
    "We'll have lots of fun in this club together"
    
A : "Yeah, [M] always gives his best as long as he's having fun"

I do appreciate their enthusiasm, but I do also feel bad for being so quiet.

At this point, [C] might as well be talking with a rock.

C : "Now I'll explain some of the things we'll be doing in this club, okay?"
    "Our job, as the Photography club, of course, is to take and select good photos"
    "They will be published on the school's wall newspaper."
    "..."
    
Despite the natural tendency to listen while someone's talking, I tune out her speech halfway through while she's listing the tasks that we'll be doing.

I let my gaze take another sweep around the classroom.

To be honest, I think [C] is very enthusiastic club President, judging by the way she hangs the decorations on the wall.

They're organized in a way that looks very eye-catching, which tells me that this club does mean a lot to her.

C: "..."
    "S-So [M], what made you consider the Photography club?"
    
This question caught me by surprise. I honestly didn't expect to hear this.

Something tells me that I shouldn't tell [C] that I was practically dragged here by [A].

But I also don't want to lie...

M : "W-Well, I haven't joined any clubs yet, and [A] seemed really happy here, so..."

[A]'s eyes darted to me for a split second.

C : "That's okay, don't be embarrassed"
    "I'll make sure that you feel comfortable here, okay?"
    "I want to encourage people to participate in something that I love, which is Photography."
    "As president of the Photography Club, it's my job to make it a fun and exciting place for everyone"
	"Everyone thinks of Photography to be something quite dull and uninteresting"
	"But it's nothing like that. It's a form of art that takes a lot of skill to master"
	"We just need a way to show them that!"
    
A : "Wow, [C] is such a great leader"

I nod in agreement with her. [C] is so passionate about this club thing.

M : "...I-I'm surprised that there aren't more people in the club yet"
    "It must have been hard starting a club from scratch, right?"
    
C : "You can put it that way"
    "Not many people are willing to to put in the effort to start something brand new"
    "You have to work hard to convince people that you're both fun and worthwhile"
    "But it makes school events, like the festival, that much more important"
    "And I'm confident that we can grow this club before we graduate"
    
To be honest, I was expecting a enthusiastic leader from the club, but I didn't knew that she would be this passionate.

She must have worked really hard to find people for this club.

That thought kind of motivates me a bit to contribute what I can to the club as well.

Though I don't know if I can keep up with their level of enthusiasm about Photography.

But I will try and put in some effort, if it makes the club members happy.

After some further discussion, [C] looks out the window, only to find a beautiful scene of sunset.

C : "..."
    "I guess the day is about to end, so we should get going now"
    "By the way, I have this idea for tomorrow's meeting."
    "Let's take some photos that either we took or we just love and bring them to school with us!"
    "We can talk about them in tomorrow's clubday"
    "..."
    "That way, everybody can get to know about each other better, and strengthen the bond of the club at the same time"
    
A : "That's a great idea"
    "I'll remember to bring mine!!"

[A] smiles warmly to me again.
    
C : "What about you, [M]?"

Hmm...

Well, I guess it could be interesting to do some storytelling tomorrow.

M : "Yeah, I'm in"

C : "Great!! So that'll be everyone's assignment for today, okay?"
    "And I think with that, we can officially end today's meeting on a good note"
    
C looks to me once again.
    
M : "And [M], I'm looking forward to hearing your story!!"
    "Hehe~!!"
    
What's that supposed to mean?

But it doesn't matter, as I'm too tired now and I need to go home and get some rest.

A : "H-Hey [M], since we're already here, do you want to walk home together?"

M : "Sure, might as well"

A : "Yaay~!!"

[A] and I packed our bags, departed from the classroom, and made our way home as usual.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(scene Street dark)

I don't usually walk home this late in the evening.

The trees hum with the wind, and I hear the sound of leaves rustling beneath me as I walk.

On the way home, my mind wanders back and forth about what happened today.

A Photography club, huh?

I wish somebody was here, so I could anchor myself to something tangible, instead of having this feeling that I stepped into a whole new world.

It isn't really my thing. Will I be happy spending every day after school in a photography club?

But I guess it's somewhat of an opportunity to do something new.

And if talking about photography is the price I need to pay in order to be closer with the most popular girl in school, then I guess it can't be that bad, right?

Can I really impress the star of the school with my mediocre taste in art?

I already feel the anxiety welling up inside me.

M : "Alright..."

I just need to make the best out of my circumstances, and good fortune will surely find me.

And I guess that starts with choosing some photos tonight...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
